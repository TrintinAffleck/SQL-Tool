# SQL-Tool
#What is this tool?
This tool connects to a database, queries it using sp_blitz script then exports the results into an excel file. The query/script is from http://FirstResponderKit.org aka Brent Ozar. All of the copyright, parameter explanations and limitations. I did not write HealthCheck it is a copy paste of his script that is free to use. 

This script checks the health of your SQL Server and gives you a prioritized
to-do list of the most urgent things you should consider fixing.

To learn more about the script, visit http://FirstResponderKit.org where you can download new
versions for free, watch training videos on how it works, get more info on
the findings, contribute your own code, and more.

#How to use?
Its pretty simple the program will ask you for the server,database,authentication of the database you
want to connect to. If it is a trusted authentication (Enter either Windows, Windows Authentication or Trusted Connection).
